Run "python main_part1.py" to get the results of Part 1
After running it, it will first generate 4 plots, and those are the sanity check for the
encoder.
Then, the results (acc etc.) will print out on the terminal.

Run "python main_part2.py" to get the results of Part 2
After the last epoch, there will be another 4 plots for the sanity check of the decoder.
Then, the results for the decoder (perplxity etc.) will print out on the terminal.

Run "python main_part3.py" to get the results of Part 3
